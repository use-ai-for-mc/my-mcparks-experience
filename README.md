# My MCParks Experience

A Fabric **1.19** client-side mod that enhances the experience of playing on the
[MCParks](https://www.mcparks.us) Minecraft server — streaming in-park audio
from MyMusic+, cleaning up the HUD, and making long ride sessions comfortable.

- **Minecraft:** 1.19
- **Loader:** Fabric (`>=0.14.8`)
- **Java:** 17+
- **Dependencies:** Fabric API, [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)
- **Suggests:** [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)
- **License:** CC0-1.0

## Features

### MyMusic+ Audio Streaming
- Streams MCParks MyMusic+ in-park audio (OGG Vorbis + MP3 via `jorbis` / `jlayer`).
- **Auto-connect** when the client joins an MCParks server — no manual step needed.
- Per-client volume control (0–100).
- Commands: `/audioconnect`, `/audiodisconnect`, `/audioreconnect`, `/volume <n>`.

### Ride Quality-of-Life
- **Cursor release on ride** — frees the mouse cursor the moment you're a
  passenger, so you can alt-tab, chat, or browse without being pinned by
  look-rotation.
- **Suppresses the "Press SHIFT to dismount" overlay** — which normally flashes
  repeatedly as MCParks transfers the player between entities during inversions.
- **Ride detection + HUD** — recognizes registered rides and renders a small
  on-screen indicator.

### HUD Cleanup
- **Hide health bar** — hides hearts, armor, and hunger (MCParks is PvE-only).
- **Hide vehicle health bar** — hides the mount-health row during coasters.
- **Hide XP level & bar** — reduces visual noise.

### Fullbright (Night Vision + Time Lock)
Four modes via the `fullbrightMode` setting:
- `NONE` — off.
- `ONLY_WHEN_RIDING` — only active while you're a passenger.
- `ONLY_WHEN_NOT_RIDING` — off while riding (useful if you prefer scenic darkness on rides).
- `ALWAYS` — always on.

Implementation injects `NIGHT_VISION` via `LivingEntity.hasEffect` /
`getEffect` and clamps the client day-time at noon to prevent sunset /
nightfall rendering.

### Movement & Utility
- **Auto `/fly`** — automatically runs `/fly` after server join (respects the
  server's own fly permissions; no-ops if the server denies it).
- **Speed multiplier** — configurable client-side sprint/walk multiplier.
- `/nearby` — list nearby players / armor stands for debugging.

### Skin Cache
Persistent on-disk cache of resolved player skin textures — skins reappear
instantly on reconnect instead of re-fetching from Mojang's session server.
Implemented via mixins on `HttpTexture` and `SkullBlockRenderer`.

### Subtitle System
Renders localized subtitles for in-park audio cues on top of the normal HUD.

## Configuration

Open the config screen in-game with **`/mymcparks`** (or from Mod Menu if
installed). Settings are persisted to
`config/my-mcparks-experience.json`:

```json
{
  "volume": 20,
  "autoConnect": true,
  "cursorReleaseOnRide": true,
  "hideMountMessageOnRide": true,
  "autoFly": true,
  "speedMultiplier": 1.0,
  "hideHealthBar": true,
  "hideExperienceLevel": true,
  "fullbrightMode": "ALWAYS"
}
```

## Server Detection

All MCParks-specific features are **gated to MCParks servers only** — they
stay inert on other servers. Detection checks:

1. `Minecraft.getCurrentServer().ip` — the saved server entry you clicked in
   the multiplayer list.
2. As a fallback, the live connection's remote hostname
   (`Connection.getRemoteAddress()` → `InetSocketAddress.getHostString()`),
   which covers **Direct Connect** and the `--server` launch argument (cases
   where `getCurrentServer()` returns `null`).

A hostname containing `"mcparks"` (case-insensitive) counts as MCParks.

## Build & Deploy

Build the mod and copy it into the local Modrinth `Fabric 1.19` profile:

```bash
./build-and-deploy.sh
```

The script runs `./gradlew build`, verifies the jar, and copies
`build/libs/my-mcparks-experience-1.0.0.jar` to
`~/Library/Application Support/ModrinthApp/profiles/Fabric 1.19/mods/`.

For a plain build without deploying:

```bash
./gradlew build
```
